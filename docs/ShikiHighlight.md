# Shiki Highlight question

## Highlight is not active

If you encounter the following message in your console:

```log
ShikiError: Language `xxx` not found, you may need to load it first
```

or notice that code block highlighting is not working, it means Shiki does not support the language specified in your code block. To resolve this, either leave the language field empty or switch to a supported language.

For a comprehensive list of supported languages, please refer to this link:

[lang support](https://shiki.style/languages)

Notably, both `moonbit` and `moonbit live` are supported.
