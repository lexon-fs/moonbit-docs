# Shiki Highlight question

## Highlight is not active

If you see the console print something like this:

``` log
ShikiError: Language `xxx` not found, you may need to load it first
```

or the code block Highlight is not active.

This is because the shiki does not support you lang which you select in the code block,you have to keep it empty or
change to another lang name.

### shiki lang support

you can see this link:

[lang support](https://shiki.style/languages)

and both `moonbit` and `moonbit live` are supported.
